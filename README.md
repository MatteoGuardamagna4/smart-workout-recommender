# Smart Workout Recommender

AI-powered personalized workout plans based on your fitness profile.

## Features

- **Fitness Quiz** — Interactive assessment to capture your profile, goals, and preferences
- **Personalized Plan** — Weekly workout plan generated using ML clustering + LLM
- **Progress Tracker** — Projected 12-week progress visualization

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (tabs, pills, toggle, sliders, expanders, metrics)
- **ML Model**: KMeans clustering (scikit-learn) to group similar fitness profiles
- **AI Generation**: LLM API (Groq) for personalized plan generation
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle - Gym Members Exercise Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/gym-members-exercise-dataset)

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download the dataset
Download `gym_members_exercise_tracking.csv` from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/gym-members-exercise-dataset) and place it in `data/gym_members.csv`.
#### An empty data folder must be created 
``` bash
mkdir data
```
### 3. (Optional) Configure LLM API (Recommended)
Set environment variables:
```bash
# For Groq:
export GROQ_API_KEY=my_key_here
```

Without an API key, the app uses a mock plan for demo purposes. 
(I recommend copy paste my personal API Key, which is in the moodle submission box).
If the user possesses a personal Groq key it can be used it as well. 

### 4. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## How It Works

1. **Quiz**: User answers questions about fitness level, goals, equipment, etc.
2. **Clustering**: User profile is matched to a cluster of similar gym members using KMeans
3. **Plan Generation**: An LLM generates a tailored weekly plan using the user's profile + cluster insights
4. **Progress**: Simulated 12-week projections based on similar users' data (Room fo future improvement: train a model to make better predictions)

## Streamlit Widgets Used
